# I2C Soil Moisture Sensor Integration for ESPHome

This is the [ESPHome](https://github.com/esphome/esphome) external component for integration with the [I2C Moisture Sensor](https://github.com/Miceuz/i2c-moisture-sensor). The sensor measures soil moisture, temperature, and light intensity.

## Example

```yaml
external_components:
  - source:
      type: git
      url: https://github.com/diptanw/esphome-i2c-sensor
      ref: main
    components: [ chirp ]

i2c:
  sda: D1
  scl: D2

sensor:
  - platform: chirp
    moisture:
      name: "Soil Moisture"
      calibration:
        min_capacity: 300  # Optional (default 245)
        max_capacity: 600  # Optional (default 550)
        raw: false         # Use inbuilt conversion.
      filters:
        - skip_initial: 1  # First read is zero, skip it.
    temperature:
      name: "Soil Temperature"
      filters:
        - skip_initial: 1  # First read is zero, skip it.
        - offset: -0.1     # Calibrate readings.
    illuminance:
      name: "Ambient Light"
      calibration:
        coefficient: -1    # Optional (default -1.525)
        constant: 100000   # Optional (default 100000)
        raw: false         # Use inbuilt conversion.
      filters:
        - skip_initial: 1  # First read is zero, skip it.
    update_interval: 5s
    address: 0x20
    new_address: 0x21      # Change the address upon startup, requires a restart.
```

## Configuration Options

- **Moisture**:
  - `calibration`:
    - `min_capacity`: Lower calibration point for moisture (default 245).
    - `max_capacity`: Upper calibration point for moisture (default 550).
    - `raw`: Use raw reading values without convertion.

    Place the sensor in dry soil to find the minimum moisture level or in water-saturated soil for the maximum level. Adjust the `min_capacity` and `max_capacity` accordingly.

    A moisture sensor provides automatic conversion from raw capacity readings into moisture percentage based on default limits. To override the conversion, set set `raw` to `true` and use `filters` to adjust it with various filters such as `calibrate_linear`, etc:

    ```yaml
    moisture:
      name: "Soil Moisture"
      calibration:
        raw: true
      filters:
        - calibrate_linear:
            method: exact
            datapoints:
              - 245 -> 0.0
              - 550 -> 100.0
        - clamp:
            min_value: 0
            max_value: 100
    ```

- **Temperature**:
  - `filters`:
    - `offset`: Temperature correction in Celsius if the sensor reads too high or low.

    If you have a known temperature source, compare and adjust the `offset` to match the known temperature.

- **Illuminance**:
  - `calibration`:
    - `coefficient`: Coefficient to adjust the light reading linearly.
    - `constant`: Constant to fine-tune light readings.
    - `raw`: Use raw reading values without convertion.

    Adjust the `coefficient` and `constant` based on known light conditions (e.g., direct sunlight vs. dark room).

    Similar to the mixture sensor, the module provides a default conversion from sensor reading to Lux values, based on the conversion formula. If you need to override it with your own calculation, set `raw` to `true`, and use `filter` and `lambda` to adjust the formula:

    ```yaml
    illuminance:
      name: "Ambient Light"
      calibration:
        raw: true
      filters:
        - lambda: return x * (-1.525) + 100000;
    ```

- **Address**
  - `new_address`: Optionally specify a new I2C address for the sensor if the default conflicts with another device on your I2C bus. This must be done before other devices on the bus are initialized to avoid conflicts. After addres is changed, set the new address to `address` field of i2c device.

## Callibration

### Illuminance Conversion Formula

The conversion from sensor readings to lux is based on the principle that the sensor output is inversely proportional to light intensity. This relationship is quantified with a linear equation derived from known calibration points:

- **Pitch Black**: Sensor reading = 65535, Lux = 0
- **Direct Sunlight**: Sensor reading = 0, Lux = 100,000 lux

#### Conversion Formula

The lux value can be calculated from the sensor reading using the formula:

```Lux = m * Sensor Reading + c```

we calculate:

- **Coefficient (m)**: `-1.525`
- **Constant (c)**: `100,000`

## Print Model

Additionally, there are models for 3D printing the casing for the sensor, which consists of two parts: top and bottom.
Note that the light reading will not be possible if you print it using non-translucent material.
